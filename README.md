Implementations of the PRESENT algorithm for a Rasberry Pi PICO 

Note: this was developed as a team as part of University coursework. This is designed to pass a series of provided test, not to be used in production. Code was inspired & adapted in part from lecture contents and other sources. I am hosting this here to help others (and as a cheap backup)
